1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

So because it is talking about a line i am thinking of an array already.

* The line is composed of members, who can be represented as strings.

members or strings are going to be the elements in the array or the people in the line.

* When you enter the line, you are placed at the back.

when you push an element to the array it will be added to the end of the array.

* People may leave the line whenever they see fit and those behind them take their place.

if someone leaves the line or an element is removed everything must shift down 1 element.



The reason I am choosing to go with an array here is because since it is a line we can hold this information in sequential order.
If someone leaves pop that element and shift the elements down.

So we can create an array to hold people.


var line_length = []

  def add_To_Line(name)
    line_length.push(name)
  end








2. Pixels on a computer screen.

*a screen has a width and a height
  a multi-dimensional array would work for this or a matrix.
  the width will be how long the arrays are.
  the height would be which row in the array. example
  [
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  [0,1,2,3,4],
  ]

  array = {}
  array.width = 5
  array.height = 5
  array.x = 3
  array.y = 0

  Value returned would be 3
* screen is composed of Pixels

fill the arrays with ints. the ints represent Pixels


* a pixel requires three color values, red, green, blue.
give each array a color based on these values

*if less than 0 then its 0, greater than 255 then its 255.

simple if else check.
