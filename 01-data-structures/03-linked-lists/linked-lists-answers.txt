This one was really confusing at first.


I may still not have a full understanding of it.

But from what i understand the way linked lists are structured are pretty interesting.

First you have to create an object, in this case Node.

And give it two attributes or properties, in this case head and or tail(structured mine a little weird)


so we're going to have something like this (head, tail) // This isn't the actual syntax

So we're going to have the head equal a value, this value can be any data type; int, float, char, string.

value isn't really important, what is important is the tail.

because the tail is going to reference the next node or in other words link to it.

so it will be something like this.

Node 1 = ('Daniel', Node 2)

Node 2 = ('Dylan', null)


Notice the null in there? The null means that it is the last node because it doesn't link to anything.

if we were to created a third node it would look like this.


Node 1 = ('Daniel', Node 2)

Node 2 = ('Dylan', Node 3)

Node 3 = ('Bloc', null)


Hope this explains it.
