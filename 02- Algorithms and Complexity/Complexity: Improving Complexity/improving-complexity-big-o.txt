version 1. This would be O(n^2) because there is a nested for loops which indicates that we are looping
 through the set of data twice.


version 2.

I used merge sort to sort and combine the data so the run time is O(nlogn)

version 3.

I believe the run time for the first time processing it would be O(nlogn)
however afterwards it would be constant because the sorted array is stored.
